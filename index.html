                        The World card is a harbinger of crossing borders both physically and spiritually,
                        and it insists that you always keep your dreams alive. Perhaps you are doubting your abilities.
                        In this position, the card tells you that the universe has given you the GREEN LIGHT and that you should continue.
                      </p>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        On the other hand, it is also interpreted as travel and displacement.
                        Whether you take the meaning of the card physically or spiritually,
                        you will achieve success and satisfaction at the end of the road.</p>

                        Nine of Pentacles indicates energy and movement in matters concerning your material values, career, and daily activities.

                        It is about replacing the 'old' with the 'new'. Don't be sad that some things are ending. The experience you gain will allow you to achieve satisfaction in both material and spiritual terms.
